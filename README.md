# üéì BE/BTech College Counselling System (C Language Project)

A comprehensive terminal-based simulation of the **college admission counselling process** for BE/BTech aspirants. Built entirely in **C language**, this project replicates real-world centralized counselling systems like MHT-CET or JEE-Main counselling by using realistic cutoffs, multiple admission rounds, user inputs, and dynamic decision-making.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This program mimics how centralized college admissions work:

- Students enter their **CET/JEE percentile**.
- They fill in a **detailed admission form** with academic records and personal data.
- The system shows a **list of top engineering colleges and branches**.
- Based on the student's percentile, the program **checks eligibility against pre-defined cutoffs**.
- It then simulates **three rounds** of counselling and college allotment.
- If eligible, the student can **accept or reject the offer**.
- Once accepted, the program generates a **formatted allotment letter** on the console.

This project is a fantastic example of **logic building, conditional checks, arrays, and user interaction** in C, ideal for academic submission or real-world simulation.

## üîß Features in Detail

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| üìù Admission Form | Collects full name, parents' names, DOB, academic percentages, school/college names, and year of passing. |
| üè´ College List | Includes 11 top government and private engineering colleges from India. |

## üìö Available Branches

- Computer Science Engineering  
- Electronics & Telecommunication  
- Electrical Engineering  
- Civil Engineering  
- Mechanical Engineering  

Each has a distinct cutoff per college and per round.

---

## üìà Counselling & Cutoff System

- The cutoff system is based on **multi-dimensional arrays**:  
  `float cutoffs[11][5][3];`  
  ‚Üí 11 colleges  
  ‚Üí 5 branches  
  ‚Üí 3 rounds (Round 1, 2, 3)

- For each round, the system checks if:
```

CET\_Percentage >= Cutoff\[college]\[branch]\[round]

````
If eligible, admission is granted. If not, the student may try again in the next round.
